Determine who will be using the application and their specific needs and expectations.

## 2. Define problem statement
Clearly state the problem or need that the application aims to address.

## 5. Analyze competitors
Study similar applications or products in the market to identify their strengths and weaknesses.

## 6. Use surveys and feedback forms

## 7. Capture functional requirements
Using all the above steps come up with functional requirements for the appliciation.
